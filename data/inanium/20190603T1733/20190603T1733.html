<h2>Dead bug construction</h2>



<p>

I built a raspberry pi based leak detector and temperature sensor for out farm. 

<br>

BOM:
<br>
<br>
Raspberry Pi Zero W
Generic water sensor from pishop.us
MCP3008 ADC
DHT11 sensor
<br>
Cost about 30 bucks.
<br>
I bought a pack of jumper wires that I soldered directly to the chips ("dead bug"). It is terrible mess, but it works and I love it.
